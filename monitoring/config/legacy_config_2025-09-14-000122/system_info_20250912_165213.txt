=== SYSTEM DISCOVERY RESULTS ===
Date: Fri Sep 12 16:52:13 EDT 2025
Hostname: ai-trading-station

=== ENVIRONMENT ===
Virtualization: none
none

=== CPU TOPOLOGY ===
nproc (online logical CPUs): 2
Online CPU range (/sys/.../online): 0-7
Online CPU IDs: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
Threads per core: 1
Cores per socket: 1
Sockets: 8
Physical cores (from lscpu): 8
SMT status: disabled

=== KERNEL ISOLATION (isolcpus) ===
Kernel cmdline isolcpus: 2,3
Isolated CPU IDs (expanded): 2 3

=== NETWORK INTERFACE INFORMATION ===
  enp130s0f0: driver=sfc, speed=10000Mb/s, state=up
    RECOMMENDED for trading (high-performance)
  enp130s0f1: driver=sfc, speed=Unknown!, state=down
    RECOMMENDED for trading (high-performance)
  eno1: driver=atlantic, speed=Unknown!, state=down
  eno2: driver=igc, speed=Unknown!, state=down
  wlp133s0f0: driver=iwlwifi, speed=, state=down
  enx76ac515f08ef: driver=rndis_host, speed=Unknown!, state=down
Suggested trading interfaces: ["enp130s0f0","enp130s0f1"]

=== IRQ AFFINITY VALIDATION (Housekeeping cores expected: 0,1) ===
  enp130s0f0: IRQs pinned to housekeeping cores [0 1] - OK
  enp130s0f1: IRQs pinned to housekeeping cores [0 1] - OK

=== ONLOAD ACCELERATION ===
OnLoad module: not loaded
OnLoad tools: available

=== GPU INFORMATION ===
  GPU 0: NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell Max-Q Workstation Edition, temperature: 44°C
  GPU 1: NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell Max-Q Workstation Edition, temperature: 41°C

=== TRADING PROCESS DISCOVERY (conservative) ===
  No known trading processes running now (this is fine).
Suggested trading processes list: []

=== CPU GOVERNORS ===
  No per-CPU governor files found (platform may not expose cpufreq).

=== GENERATED CONFIGURATION TEMPLATE ===

{
  "cpu": {
    "isolated_cores": [2,3],
    "expected_governor": "performance"
  },
  "network": {
    "trading_interfaces": ["enp130s0f0"]

=== SUMMARY & NOTES ===
Trading cores candidate (for monitoring isolated_cores): [2,3]
Housekeeping cores expected: [0,1] (validated against online: 0 1)
IRQ pinning status was checked per NIC above.
Virtualization: none
none (if not 'none', discovered CPU counts reflect the guest, not the bare-metal host).
