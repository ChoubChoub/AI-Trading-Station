# AI Trading Station

## Overview
This project is a cost-efficient, medium-frequency algorithmic trading platform designed to execute strategies on 1-minute to 1-hour timeframes using tick-level market data. It employs a hybrid competitive-collaborative multi-agent architecture for intelligent decision-making, executing orders in ≤ 50ms. The platform leverages dual RTX 6000 Pro configurations to combine institutional-grade intelligence with retail-level costs.

## Key Features
- **Tick-Level Data Utilization**: Employs tick-level data to implement strategies that operate on 1-minute to 1-hour frequencies, ensuring precise and timely decision-making.
- **Hybrid Architecture**: Implements a competitive-collaborative framework that delivers 85-90% of the benefits of a pure competitive framework with reduced operational risk.
- **AI-Driven Intelligence**: Focuses on competitive performance through advanced AI rather than pure speed.
- **High VRAM Capacity**: Utilizes 192GB total VRAM (2× RTX 6000 Pro with 96GB each) for strategic model selection and phased competitive implementation.
- **Evidence-Based Innovation**: Ensures sustainable trading performance through an evidence-based approach rather than relying solely on architectural sophistication.

## Multi-Agent System Architecture
### Strategic Philosophy
Recent studies show that hybrid systems combining competition and collaboration among trading agents can effectively balance innovation with operational stability. Our platform applies this principle through a phased competitive framework: specialized agents participate in weekly tournaments, where their trading impact is initially capped at 10% of total capital. Agents are tested through adversarial validation, and capital is allocated according to performance. This structure ensures constant competitive pressure to innovate while preserving overall portfolio stability and coordination. Over time, the allocation cap may be raised, provided operational robustness is maintained.

### Competitive Framework Implementation
- **Foundation with Limited Competition**: Weekly tournament with 4 strategy agents.
- **Competitive allocation**: Limited to 10% of total capital.
- **Tournament Mechanics**:
  - Each agent generates predictions for next trading session.
  - Challenge Generator identifies weaknesses in each strategy's reasoning.
  - Agents must defend their positions against challenges.
  - Performance scoring with challenge resilience.
  - Capital allocation based on tournament results (capped at 10% initially)
- **Initial Capital Allocation Rules**:
   - Base allocation (90%) proportional to recent risk-adjusted performance (70% weight).
   - Competitive allocation (10% max) based on tournament results.
   - Innovation bonus for novel approaches showing promise (within competitive allocation).
   - Diversity adjustment to prevent strategy homogeneity (within competitive allocation).

### Agent Communication Architecture
- **Primary Bus**: Redis Streams with UNIX domain sockets for <2μs inter-agent latency
- **Event Types**: MarketEvent, SignalEvent, RiskAlert, OrderEvent, FillEvent, ChallengeEvent,
DefenseEvent, TournamentResultEvent
- **Message Format**: JSON with timestamp, agent_id, confidence_score, competitive_score, and
payload
- **Consumer Groups**: Each agent subscribes to relevant streams with automatic
acknowledgment
- **Persistence**: All events written to QuestDB with SHA-256 hash chain for audit trail
- **Competition-Specific Enhancements**:
   - ChallengeEvent: Contains adversarial questions targeting strategy weaknesses.
   - DefenseEvent : Contains strategy agent's counter-arguments.
   - TournamentResultEvent : Contains final capital allocation decisions

### Operating System and Low Level Optimization
**Operating System**: Ubuntu Server 24.04.3 LTS with Minimal GUI Setup for Low-Latency Systems.
**GUI Setup**: Provide just enough desktop functionality for monitoring, management, or launching trading applications, while minimizing background activity and resource usage.
- **Display Manager:**  
  [LightDM](https://github.com/canonical/lightdm) is used as the lightweight login/session manager, providing fast startup and minimal overhead.
- **X Server:**  
  [Xorg](https://www.x.org/wiki/) is selected for its compatibility and configurability with most graphical environments and remote tools.
- **Desktop Environment:**  
  [XFCE](https://www.xfce.org/) is chosen for its lightweight footprint and efficient resource usage, running only the essential panel, window manager, and desktop components.

### Rationale

- **Minimal Overhead:**  
  Only the necessary GUI components are installed and running, reducing CPU usage and background “noise” on the system.
- **Fast Startup:**  
  LightDM and XFCE are optimized for quick login and minimal graphical bloat.
- **Configuration Flexibility:**  
  XFCE allows for easy customization, and components like compositing, notifications, and desktop effects can be disabled for additional performance gains.
- **Low Jitter:**  
  The minimal GUI setup is intentionally kept separate from performance-critical CPU cores via CPU affinity and process isolation.

### Typical Installed Packages

- `lightdm`
- `xorg`
- `xfce4`
- `xfce4-panel`
- `xfwm4`
- `xfdesktop`
- (Optional) `xfce4-terminal`, `thunar` (file manager)

### Additional Recommendations

- **Disable Unused Services:**  
  Avoid starting unnecessary background daemons, applets, or notifications.
- **Compositor:**  
  XFCE compositing can be disabled for lower latency via `Settings > Window Manager Tweaks > Compositor`.
- **Autostart:**  
  Limit autostarted programs in XFCE to essentials only.
- **Session Management:**  
  Avoid session restoration of non-essential applications.

### Process Isolation

All GUI processes (LightDM, Xorg, XFCE components) are pinned to specific CPU cores (e.g., 0 and 1) using CPU affinity, as detailed in the CPU Affinity Isolation section above. This ensures no GUI activity can interfere with isolated trading or real-time workloads.

**This setup provides a stable, responsive, and low-overhead desktop environment that supports monitoring and management without compromising system determinism or low-latency performance.**

Monitoring Core Isolation, IRQ Affinity, and Hardware Health

Ensuring the performance and reliability of a low-latency trading platform requires continuous monitoring of several critical system KPIs. This monitoring framework is designed to provide early detection of configuration drift, resource contention, or hardware anomalies that could jeopardize latency, determinism, or system stability.

1. Core Isolation & IRQ Affinity Monitoring

Objective: Guarantee that isolated CPU cores (e.g., cores 2 and 3) remain free from OS, user, and device interrupt noise, preserving them exclusively for latency-sensitive trading workloads.
Key KPIs:
CPU Utilization per Core: Cores assigned for trading should exhibit near 100% idle when the application is not running, and show no irq or softirq activity.
IRQ Event Distribution: All network (NIC) and other relevant hardware interrupts must be pinned to non-isolated cores (e.g., cores 0 and 1). Regular checks of /proc/interrupts ensure that no IRQ events are handled by isolated cores.
Process Affinity: Only essential kernel threads should appear on isolated cores outside trading application runtime.
2. Hardware Health Monitoring

Objective: Prevent performance degradation or hardware failure by tracking vital system temperatures and other health metrics.
Key KPIs:
CPU Temperature: Continuous polling of CPU thermal sensors to detect overheating.
GPU Temperature (if applicable): Monitoring via vendor utilities (e.g., nvidia-smi for NVIDIA GPUs).
Fan Speeds, Power Consumption: Optional, for early detection of cooling or power delivery issues.
3. Implementation Considerations

Automated Scripts: Deploy custom or open-source scripts to check isolation status, IRQ distribution, and sensor data, with results logged and/or visualized.
Alerting: Integrate with monitoring platforms (e.g., Prometheus, Zabbix, Nagios) to trigger alerts if KPIs fall outside acceptable ranges (e.g., IRQs on isolated cores, excessive temperatures).
Audit and Validation: Regularly validate that systemd services and boot-time configurations enforce the intended affinity and isolation settings after reboots or upgrades.
4. Operational Benefits

Reduced Latency and Jitter: By preventing interrupt and process pollution of trading cores, the system maintains deterministic performance.
Proactive Issue Detection: Early warnings on hardware or configuration drift minimize downtime and performance incidents.
Auditability: Persistent monitoring logs and reports provide compliance and troubleshooting evidence.
