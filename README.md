# AI Trading Station

## Overview
This project is a cost-efficient, medium-frequency algorithmic trading platform designed to execute strategies on 1-minute to 1-hour timeframes using tick-level market data. It employs a hybrid competitive-collaborative multi-agent architecture for intelligent decision-making, executing orders in ≤ 50ms. The platform leverages dual RTX 6000 Pro configurations to combine institutional-grade intelligence with retail-level costs.

## Key Features
- **Tick-Level Data Utilization**: Employs tick-level data to implement strategies that operate on 1-minute to 1-hour frequencies, ensuring precise and timely decision-making.
- **Hybrid Architecture**: Implements a competitive-collaborative framework that delivers 85-90% of the benefits of a pure competitive framework with reduced operational risk.
- **AI-Driven Intelligence**: Focuses on competitive performance through advanced AI rather than pure speed.
- **High VRAM Capacity**: Utilizes 192GB total VRAM (2× RTX 6000 Pro with 96GB each) for strategic model selection and phased competitive implementation.
- **Evidence-Based Innovation**: Ensures sustainable trading performance through an evidence-based approach rather than relying solely on architectural sophistication.

## Multi-Agent System Architecture
### Strategic Philosophy
Recent research highlights that hybrid competitive-collaborative multi-agent trading systems achieve an optimal balance between innovation and operational stability. Our platform implements a phased competitive framework where specialized agents compete in weekly tournaments with a limited allocation impact of 10%. These agents undergo adversarial validation and receive capital allocations based on their performance. This approach fosters continuous innovation pressure while ensuring portfolio-level coordination and operational stability. The allocation ratio may increase in later stages, contingent upon maintaining operational stability.

### Competitive Framework Implementation
- **Foundation with Limited Competition**: Weekly tournament with 4 strategy agents.
- **Competitive allocation**: Limited to 10% of total capital.
- **Tournament Mechanics**:
  - Each agent generates predictions for next trading session.
  - Challenge Generator identifies weaknesses in each strategy's reasoning.
  - Agents must defend their positions against challenges.
  - Performance scoring with challenge resilience.
  - Capital allocation based on tournament results (capped at 10% initially)
- **Initial Capital Allocation Rules**:
   - Base allocation (90%) proportional to recent risk-adjusted performance (70% weight).
   - Competitive allocation (10% max) based on tournament results.
   - Innovation bonus for novel approaches showing promise (within competitive allocation).
   - Diversity adjustment to prevent strategy homogeneity (within competitive allocation).

### Agent Communication Architecture
- **Primary Bus**: Redis Streams with UNIX domain sockets for <2μs inter-agent latency
- **Event Types**: MarketEvent, SignalEvent, RiskAlert, OrderEvent, FillEvent, ChallengeEvent,
DefenseEvent, TournamentResultEvent
- **Message Format**: JSON with timestamp, agent_id, confidence_score, competitive_score, and
payload
- **Consumer Groups**: Each agent subscribes to relevant streams with automatic
acknowledgment
- **Persistence**: All events written to QuestDB with SHA-256 hash chain for audit trail
- **Competition-Specific Enhancements**:
   - ChallengeEvent: Contains adversarial questions targeting strategy weaknesses.
   - DefenseEvent : Contains strategy agent's counter-arguments.
   - TournamentResultEvent : Contains final capital allocation decisions

## 🎯 Quick Start

### Launch Trading Application (Recommended)
```bash
# Auto-detect best configuration
./scripts/onload-trading --mode=auto ./your-trading-app

# Maximum performance (requires root)
sudo ./scripts/onload-trading --mode=strict ./your-trading-app

# OnLoad only (no root required)
./scripts/onload-trading --mode=onload-only ./your-trading-app
```

### System Monitoring & Demo
```bash
# Show system status and performance metrics
./ai-trading-station.sh status

# Run trading latency demonstration
./ai-trading-station.sh demo

# Start real-time monitoring
./ai-trading-station.sh monitor
```

## 🔧 Prerequisites

### Essential Requirements
1. **Solarflare OnLoad drivers** (for kernel bypass)
2. **CPU core isolation** (for consistent latency)
3. **Root privileges** (for strict mode with optimal performance)

### Installation Steps
```bash
# 1. Install OnLoad drivers (contact Solarflare/Xilinx for drivers)
# 2. Configure CPU isolation in GRUB
sudo sed -i 's/GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=.*/GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="isolcpus=2,3 nohz_full=2,3 rcu_nocbs=2,3"/' /etc/default/grub
sudo update-grub

# 3. Reboot for isolation to take effect
sudo reboot
```

## 📊 Technical Implementation Details

### OnLoad Configuration
The `scripts/onload-trading` wrapper implements:
```bash
EF_POLL_USEC=0              # Zero-latency polling mode
EF_SPIN_USEC=1000000        # 1-second spin timeout
EF_RXQ_SIZE=2048           # Optimized receive queue
EF_TXQ_SIZE=1024           # Optimized transmit queue
EF_TCP_NONBLOCKING_FAST_PATH=1  # Non-blocking TCP
EF_UDP_NONBLOCKING_FAST_PATH=1  # Non-blocking UDP
```

### Three Fallback Modes
1. **Strict Mode**: Full optimization with root privileges
   - OnLoad kernel bypass
   - CPU core isolation (cores 2,3)
   - IRQ isolation to core 0
   - **Result: 4.37μs mean latency**

2. **OnLoad-Only Mode**: Kernel bypass without isolation
   - OnLoad kernel bypass only
   - No CPU or IRQ isolation required
   - **Result: 8-12μs mean latency**

3. **Auto Mode**: Intelligent detection
   - Detects available features
   - Uses strict mode if root + cores available
   - Falls back to onload-only otherwise

### Safety Features
- CPU core availability validation
- Graceful fallback when resources unavailable
- Production-grade error handling
- Comprehensive logging to `/var/log/onload-trading.log`

## 🏗️ System Modules

The AI Trading Station includes comprehensive system optimization modules:

- **[Module 1](Module%201)**: VS Code & GitHub Copilot development environment
- **[Module 2](Module%202)**: BIOS & hardware optimization for <50μs jitter
- **[Module 3](Module%203)**: GPU configuration for <2ms inference variance
- **[Module 4](Module%204)**: System performance tuning for <500μs IPC latency

These modules provide the foundation, but **`scripts/onload-trading`** delivers the core performance breakthrough.

## 🎪 Demo & Monitoring

The `ai-trading-station.sh` script provides user-friendly monitoring capabilities:

```bash
# Performance status check
./ai-trading-station.sh status

# Interactive latency simulation
./ai-trading-station.sh demo

# Real-time system monitoring
./ai-trading-station.sh monitor
```

**Note**: This is a monitoring utility only. All performance-critical operations are handled by `scripts/onload-trading`.

## 📈 Performance Validation

### Measurement Tools
```bash
# Latency measurement
cyclictest -t1 -p99 -i100 -h400 -q --duration=30s

# Network performance
netperf -H target_host -t TCP_RR

# System jitter analysis
hwlatdetect --duration=300
```

### Expected Results
- **Mean latency**: 4.37μs (strict mode)
- **P99 latency**: <8.2μs
- **Jitter**: <0.5μs standard deviation
- **CPU utilization**: Dedicated cores at 100% efficiency

## 🛡️ Production Deployment

### Pre-flight Checklist
- [ ] OnLoad drivers installed and tested
- [ ] CPU cores 2,3 isolated via GRUB configuration
- [ ] IRQ isolation configured
- [ ] Trading application tested with `scripts/onload-trading`
- [ ] Performance validation completed
- [ ] Monitoring setup with `ai-trading-station.sh status`

### Launch Command
```bash
# Production launch with full optimization
sudo ./scripts/onload-trading --mode=strict --cores=2,3 ./your-production-trading-app
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **"OnLoad not installed"**: Install Solarflare OnLoad drivers
2. **"Core X not available"**: Adjust `--cores` parameter or add more CPU cores
3. **"Cannot create log file"**: Ensure write permissions to `/var/log/`
4. **Higher than expected latency**: Verify CPU isolation with `cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/isolated`

### Performance Debugging
```bash
# Check OnLoad status
onload_tool reload

# Verify CPU isolation
cat /proc/cmdline | grep isolcpus

# Monitor IRQ distribution
watch -n1 'cat /proc/interrupts | head -20'

# Real-time performance monitoring
./ai-trading-station.sh monitor
```
