BIOS Setup
1.

Knowing BIOS
NOTE: The new ASUS UEFI BIOS is a Unified Extensible Interface that complies with UEFI
architecture, offering a user-friendly interface that goes beyond the traditional keyboard-only BIOS
controls to enable a more flexible and convenient mouse input. You can easily navigate the new
UEFI BIOS with the same smoothness as your operating system. The term “BIOS” in this user
manual refers to “UEFI BIOS” unless otherwise specified.

BIOS (Basic Input and Output System) stores system hardware settings such as storage
device configuration, overclocking settings, advanced power management, and boot
device configuration that are needed for system startup in the motherboard CMOS. In
normal circumstances, the default BIOS settings apply to most conditions to ensure
optimal performance. DO NOT change the default BIOS settings except in the following
circumstances:
•

An error message appears on the screen during the system bootup and requests you
to run the BIOS Setup.

•

You have installed a new system component that requires further BIOS settings or
update.
CAUTION! Inappropriate BIOS settings may result to instability or boot failure. We strongly
recommend that you change the BIOS settings only with the help of a trained service personnel.

IMPORTANT! We Strongly recommend ALWAYS using the ZIP file from the ASUS website to
update your BIOS when using ASUS EZ Flash, so that the ME version will be updated as well. If you
opt to only use the CAP file, make sure the ME version matches the new BIOS. Keep in mind that
once the ME is updated, it cannot be rolled back. For more information please check the product
page on the ASUS website.

NOTE:
• When downloading or updating the BIOS file for your motherboard, rename it as XXXXX.CAP or
launch the BIOSRenamer.exe application to automatically rename the file. The name of the CAP
file varies depending on models. Refer to the user manual that came with your motherboard for
the name.
• The screenshots in this manual are for reference only, please refer to the latest BIOS version for
settings and options.
• BIOS settings and options may vary due to different BIOS release versions or CPU installed.
Please refer to the latest BIOS version for settings and options.

AVX2 Ratio Offset
AVX2 Ratio Offset. Specifies number of bins to decrease AVX ratio vs. Core Ratio. AVX
is a more stressful workload, it is helpful to lower the AVX ratio to ensure maximum
possible ratio for SSE workloads. Uses Mailbox MSR 0x150, cmd 0x1B. Range 0 - 31.
0 = No offset.
AVX2 Voltage Guardband Scale Factor
AVX2 Voltage Guardband Scale Factor. Controls the voltage guardband applied to AVX
workloads. Range 0 - 200 in 1/100 units, where 125 = 1.25 scale factor. A default value
of 100 applies the default voltage guardband scale factor of 1.0. A value > 100 will
increase the votlage guardband, and < 100 will decrease the voltage guardband.

DRAM Timing Control
The sub-items in this menu allow you to set the DRAM timing control features. Use the
<+> and <-> keys to adjust the value. To restore the default setting, type [Auto] using the

CPU Graphics Load-line Calibration
The load-line is defined by the Intel VRM specification and affects the CPU Graphics
power voltage. The CPU Graphics working voltage will decrease proportionally
depending on the CPU Graphics loading. Higher levels of the load-line calibration can
get a higher voltage and a better overclocking performance but increase the CPU
Graphics and VRM thermal production. Select from level 1 to 8 to adjust the CPU
Graphics power voltage from 100% to 0%.
Configuration options: [Auto] [Level 1] [Level 2] [Level 3] [Level 4] [Level 5] [Level 6]
[Level 7] [Level 8]
CAUTION! The boosted performance may vary depending on the CPU Graphics specification. Do
not remove the thermal module.

CPU Graphics Current Capability
