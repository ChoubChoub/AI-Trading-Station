# HFT-Optimized Onload Configuration
# Created: 2025-10-01
# Purpose: Enable physical memory mode for ultra-low latency trading
# User: youssefbahloul (GID 1000)
#
# This configuration enables EF_PACKET_BUFFER_MODE=2 (physical address mode)
# which provides ~25% latency reduction over standard mode by allowing
# direct physical memory access for DMA operations.
#
# Security Note: Physical mode bypasses kernel memory protection.
# Only enable on dedicated trading systems.
