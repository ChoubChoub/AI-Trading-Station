## Rollback Procedure

```bash
# =============================================================================
# ROLLBACK PROCEDURE
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
cat > ~/bios_rollback_procedure.txt << 'EOF'
===== BIOS OPTIMIZATION ROLLBACK PROCEDURE =====

If system instability occurs after BIOS optimization, follow these steps:

1. STANDARD BIOS RESET:
   a. Enter BIOS (press Delete key during boot)
   b. Navigate to "Exit" menu
   c. Select "Load Optimized Defaults" and confirm
   d. Save changes and exit (F10)
   * Expected time: 60 seconds

2. IF SYSTEM WON'T BOOT TO BIOS:
   a. Power off the system completely
   b. Disconnect power cable
   c. Locate the CMOS reset jumper on motherboard
      * ASUS ROG Maximus Z790: Near bottom-right edge of motherboard
      * Labeled "CLRTC" with two pins
   d. Move jumper cap to cover both pins (or use metal screwdriver to short pins)
   e. Wait 10 seconds
   f. Return jumper to original position
   g. Reconnect power and boot
   * Expected time: 90 seconds

3. HARDWARE CMOS RESET (if jumper method fails):
   a. Power off the system completely
   b. Disconnect power cable
   c. Open case
   d. Locate the CMOS battery (silver coin cell on motherboard)
   e. Carefully remove battery for 1 minute
   f. Reinstall battery
   g. Close case, reconnect power, and boot
   * Expected time: 120 seconds

4. MINIMAL PERFORMANCE CONFIGURATION:
   After resetting BIOS to defaults, apply only these settings:
   a. XMP/EXPO → ENABLED (Profile 1)
   b. Above 4G Decoding → ENABLED
   c. Re-Size BAR Support → ENABLED
   d. CPU Fan Profile → Performance or Manual (65%+ at 65°C)
   * Expected time: 30 seconds

5. VERIFICATION STEPS:
   After rollback, run these commands to verify system is functional:
   
   # Check CPU frequency scaling is working
   watch -n 1 "cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep MHz | head -5"
   # Expected: Frequencies should vary between idle and load
   
   # Verify memory configuration
   sudo dmidecode --type memory | grep -A 5 "Size:"
   # Expected: All memory modules should be detected at XMP speed
   
   # Confirm GPU detection with proper PCIe link
   lspci -vv | grep -A 10 VGA
   # Expected: GPU should be detected with functional link

IMPORTANT NOTES:
- Default settings will re-enable power management features
- System will have higher peak performance but less consistent latency
- This configuration is suitable for development but suboptimal for trading
- Run baseline measurements again to confirm return to original performance

Estimated total rollback time: < 120 seconds

# =============================================================================
```

This module delivers institutional-grade hardware optimization on retail hardware by eliminating frequency scaling, dynamic power states, and memory timing variations that cause unpredictable execution timing. The comprehensive configuration targets a consistent <50μs latency environment essential for reliable trading execution.

The retail hardware limitations are documented throughout, with specific comparisons to institutional-grade hardware at each step. The validation protocol provides quantifiable before/after metrics to verify optimization effectiveness, while the rollback procedure ensures you can safely return to default settings if needed.

For best results, follow the BIOS optimization guides exactly as specified, then run the validation script to confirm your hardware meets the deterministic performance targets required for trading operations.
